Assignment #1: Docker Containers

## Overview
  
What the Stack Does

This project builds and runs a simple multi-container stack using Docker Compose, featuring:
- A **PostgreSQL service** container initialized with a seeded table of trip data.
- A **Python application** container that connects to the database, queries data, computes basic statistics, and outputs results as a JSON file and console printout.

This setup introduces essential Docker and Docker Compose concepts such as service networking, environment variable configuration, health checks, and multi-container orchestration.

## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running  
- Docker Compose  
- GitHub Desktop (for version control, optional)  
- An IDE or text editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)  

Make sure you can run basic Docker commands.

## Running the Stack

From the project root, create the output directory (if not exists):

>mkdir -p out

Build and start the stack with:

>docker compose up --build

Alternatively, use the Makefile for easier commands:

>make all

This will build images, start both containers, wait for the database to be ready, run the Python app, which connects to the database, performs queries, computes statistics, writes results to `out/summary.json`, and prints the summary JSON to the terminal.

## Output

The application writes its JSON summary output file to the out/ directory in the project root.

After running the stack, you will find the generated file at: out/summary.json

    }
  ]
}

## Troubleshooting

- **DB not ready:** The app retries connecting multiple times; ensure the database container is healthy.  
- **Port conflicts:** Verify port 5432 is free or change PostgreSQL port in the Compose file.  
- **Permission issues:** Ensure the `out/` directory has write permissions for the app container.
- **Docker daemon not running:** Make sure Docker Desktop is running and has enough allocated resources.

## Cleaning Up

To stop and remove containers and volumes:

> make down
